This Sinatra app was written because I was curious as to how many Facebook wall posts were "Happy Birthday" wall posts.
The app looks at all your friends and the posts on their walls from 1 Jul 2010 00:00:00 UTC to 30 Jun 2011 23:59:59 UTC.

Here's how you can use this app for yourself:

1. Set up a Facebook application and fill up the CLIENT_ID and APP_SECRET in fb_birthdays.rb
2. Hit the /sign_in page
3. Analyze the results!
