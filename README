This light Rails app was written because I was curious as to how many Facebook wall posts were "Happy Birthday" wall posts. The app looks at all your friends and the posts on their walls from 1 Jul 2010 00:00:00 UTC to 30 Jun 2011 23:59:59 UTC. It counts the total number of posts during this one year period and how many of them contain the string "happy b" (case insensitive)

Here's how you can use this app for yourself:

1. Set up a Facebook application and fill up the CLIENT_ID and APP_SECRET in facebook_controller.rb
2. If you're running on your local machine (on port 3000), go to http://localhost:3000/sign_in
3. Analyze the results!

This uses the fb_graph 1.9.1 gem.
